    This file should be rendered at the URL loaded by the loader.js
    to display the File Explorer.

    When executing `grunt` this file will be compiled to
    dist/explorer/explorer.html, with the _explorer.html file included.
    Therefore, all that is required is for the CSS/JS links below to
    point to the right location, and this HTML file can be used to render
    the File Explorer.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>File Explorer</title>
    <!-- CHANGEME: Point this link to the URL the stylesheet is available at. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/file-explorer/css/explorer.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <!--
        CHANGEME (Optional):
        Include /dist/explorer/_explorer.html here, either with a template tag,
        or compiling in the contents.
    -->
    include "../dist/explorer/_explorer.html"

    <!-- CHANGEME: Point this link to the URL the JavaScript file is available at. -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/file-explorer/js/explorer.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    For an example implementation of this template, check out the one used
    by the test server at test/views/file-explorer.jade.
